Project consists of 6 files with .py extension and 1 file with .csv extension also 1 file with .txt extension
Main.py is the starting and main part of the project. This file takes functions and variables from other python files.

-->> As a RESULT, the Main.py file should be run.<<--  


Brief description :
- Firstly, menu appears on the screen. Customer should choose Pizza Base and sauce. Also customer can choose extra sauce as his/her choose
- According to the given order, pizza description and payment appears on the screen. As a next step, customer should enter information (e.g ID number, Credit Card number etc.) for payment
- Before paying the product, Payment history (with detailed information and time) can be added to the database (Orders_Database.csv) based on customer's choice


This code was created in VSCode IDE environment. While running the Main.py there can be some errors about finding module 
  (e.g ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'importMenu') Sometimes this happens when using another ide or etc. 
  To prevent this issue, i created another file PioSystemTotal.py consisting of all files. You can also run this file for see the result :)
